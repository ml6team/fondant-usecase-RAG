    "### Pipeline overview\n",
    "\n",

    "database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipeline Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Data Loading](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/tree/main/components/load_from_parquet): The\n",
    "  pipeline begins by loading text data from a Parquet file, which serves as the\n",
    "  source for subsequent processing. For the minimal example we are using a dataset from Huggingface.\n",
    "- [Text Chunking](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/tree/main/components/chunk_text): Text data is\n",
    "  chunked into manageable sections to prepare it for embedding. This\n",
    "  step\n",
    "  is crucial for performant RAG systems.\n",
    "- [Text Embedding](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/tree/main/components/embed_text): We are using\n",
    "  a small HuggingFace model for the generation of text embeddings.\n",
    "  The `embed_text` component easily allows the usage of different models as well.\n",
    "- [Write to Weaviate](https://github.com/ml6team/fondant/tree/main/components/index_weaviate): The\n",
    "  final step of the pipeline involves writing the embedded text data to\n",
    "  a Weaviate database.\n",
